The Deep Zoom module provides the ability to create interactively viewable
high-resolution images using the Microsoft Deep Zoom file format and the
Seadragon Ajax library, ala Zoom.it but hosted 100% locally.

Deep Zoom was written Stuart Clark and is maintained by Stuart Clark (deciphered) 
and Brian Gilbert (realityloop) of Realityloop Pty Ltd.
